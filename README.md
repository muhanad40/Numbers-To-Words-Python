Numbers to Words (Python)
=========================
A personal Python challenge I wanted to take on. This script takes a numerical input and outputs the words in English. This was coded using Test/Behaviour Driven Development (PyUnit).

# NOTE
I wrote this script in JavaScript and Ruby

# Usage
```python
from NumbersToWords/lib import NumbersToWords
numbers_to_words = NumbersToWords()
print numbers_to_words.convert(123) #=> "One Hundred and Twenty Three"
```
